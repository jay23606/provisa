"""The local result sink: a large result written to a file in the org's folder and served over
HTTP to the user who asked for it (REQ-1191, REQ-1192, REQ-1193, REQ-1195).

A delivery that no object store takes is written here (``redirect.run_materialize`` chooses):
in ``<org folder>/results/<name>``, by the engine itself where it writes the format to a file
(DuckDB's ``COPY ... TO``, Postgres's ``COPY ... TO STDOUT``), otherwise by Provisa from the
result's rows. Beside each result is its record, ``<name>.owner``: the user who asked for it and
its media type. ``GET /data/redirect-file/<name>`` serves it to that user alone, checked from
the request's own identity on every fetch. A result older than ``redirect.ttl`` is gone: refused
when fetched, and deleted -- at its expiry by a timer, as the object store's results are
(``redirect.schedule_s3_cleanup``), and by the sweep each new result makes of the org's results,
which takes the ones whose timer a restart ended."""
