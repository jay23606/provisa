"""Each org's folder: the one place the files Provisa keeps for it go (REQ-1992).

A source's conversion caches and downloads, its connector server's working files, replicas,
spools, large results and every temporary file are written under ``<data dir>/orgs/<org id>``
and nowhere else. The folder is durable.

A deployment of several nodes shares one mount of the data folder (``org_files.shared_mount``):
every node reads and writes the same org folders. What belongs to one process -- a connector
server's run directory, a replica spool, temporary files -- is kept in the node's own subtree,
``orgs/<org>/nodes/<node id>`` (``org_files.node_id``, the pod or host name), so nodes never write
each other's.

The folder is made ready when the org's runtime is built on a node (:func:`prepare`). An org that
has turned on encryption has its folder mounted encrypted instead
(``provisa.core.org_folder_crypt``). Asked for while it is not ready, the folder is refused by name
(:class:`OrgFolderUnavailable`): nothing is written anywhere else in its place.
