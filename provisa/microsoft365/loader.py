"""A Microsoft 365 source's tables, read and landed (REQ-1923).

One source reads one mailbox and offers the six canonical mail tables
(``provisa.core.canonical_mail``): ``messages``, ``message_recipients``, ``folders``,
``message_folders``, ``threads`` and ``attachments``. Each is read whole, through Microsoft
Graph (``provisa.microsoft365.mail``), into rows of exactly the canonical columns, and landed as
a replica like any fetched source.

Graph is read with a blocking client; each batch is fetched off the event loop and only one is
held. A message whose HTML body Graph will not give keeps its row without it; the read counts
such messages and names them when it ends: every id in the log, and the count with the first
ids as the build's note on the replica, the one every mail source gives.
