"""A MotherDuck table exposed in a Postgres engine by pg_duckdb (REQ-1868, issue 254).

pg_duckdb does not import MotherDuck tables as foreign tables. A server of ``TYPE 'motherduck'``
and a user mapping holding the token start its background sync worker, which creates each
MotherDuck table as a ``duckdb`` table in a Postgres schema of its own naming, some seconds later:

* the server's default database: its ``main`` schema is ``public``, any other schema keeps its
  name;
* any other database: its ``main`` is ``ddb$<db>``, any other schema is ``ddb$<db>$<schema>``.

The sync is not done when a table first appears: a restart of the worker re-syncs, recreating
tables under new OIDs (seen live: a resync some 6 s after the first, and a read failing "could not
open relation with OID"). A database is read once its synced tables -- their OIDs and MotherDuck
catalog versions in pg_duckdb's ``duckdb.tables`` -- have held still for ``SETTLE_S``, checked
once per database per engine runtime.

pg_duckdb holds one MotherDuck server per Postgres instance (a second fails "MotherDuck FDW
already exists"), so the server is the engine's, whatever it is named, and the engine is signed in
to one MotherDuck account: a source holding another account's token is refused by name.
