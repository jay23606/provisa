"""A ServiceNow source's connection settings (REQ-1954), read by both of its readers: the pgwire
server's model (``pgwire_replica``) and the Trino catalog (``trino_connectors``).

The adapter reads each table through the instance's Table API. It requests only the selected
columns (``sysparm_fields``) and sends a filter (``sysparm_query``) only in a form verified against
a live instance; every other filter, and every sort and limit, is applied to the rows it reads. The
instance's whole table list is offered; a table's columns are read only when it is selected for
registration."""
