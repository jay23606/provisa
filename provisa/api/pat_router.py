"""Self-service personal access tokens (REQ-1263).

Every route acts on the caller's own tokens in their active org. There is no path here to read
or revoke another user's token: a PAT is a personal credential, so administering one belongs to
the user who holds it, and revocation on behalf of someone else happens through org membership
removal (``remove_from_org``), not through this router.
