"""A view's name inside a string literal is a value, not a reference to it (REQ-135).

A compiled read -- a REST or GraphQL read of a view -- names its table in a literal, ``'city.
view_x' AS "_name_"``. View expansion put the view's SQL into that literal too, and the statement
no longer parsed (HTTP 500 on a REST read of any view)."""
