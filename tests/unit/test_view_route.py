"""How a statement that reads a view is routed (REQ-135, REQ-1163), in the one semantic statement.

A view is replaced by its SQL before governance, so the governed statement names only the tables
the view reads. When those are one source's, the statement may go to that source's own driver:
the direct lowering is built from the governed statement, which holds the view's SQL, so no bare
view name reaches the driver. A view kept through governance -- materialized and seen whole by
the reader, another region's copy, a bitemporal view -- still reaches routing as a reference,
which no source's driver knows: it goes to the engine, where its stored rows are put in."""
